# The Room Where It Happens

### Time Machine Themed Interactive Web Game
This game is intended to take the user back in time throughout different variations on the South American People's exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History. This web-based game presents the room at different points in the museum's history, featuring various artifacts that were present in that time's exhibit. The goal of the game is for the user to find the one artifact that is out of place, and click on that item to take the user to the artifact's correct time period. It has a choose-your-own-adventure twist to it that can work well with many different variations of the game.

Development progress is currently at setting up one room of the exhibit from one time period. The game can be extended to any other past exhibits at AMNH, to give any user (especially those that might not be able to come to the museum physically) the chance to travel through time in the halls of AMNH.
